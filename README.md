# RFID-Based Smart Door Lock Systemüîí

This project is a **Smart Door Lock System** powered by **RFID technology**, built using Arduino. It enables secure access by scanning RFID cards and automatically controlling a servo motor to lock/unlock a door. The system uses an LCD to provide real-time feedback, and features a lockout mechanism after multiple failed access attempts.

## üìÇ Files Included

- `Door_Lock_system_main.ino` ‚Äì The main code that handles authentication, servo control, lockout logic, and LCD messages.
- `RFID_tag_scan_code.ino` ‚Äì A utility script to scan and display RFID card UIDs for registration purposes.

## üìö Required Libraries

Make sure to install the following Arduino libraries before uploading the code:

1. **Servo**  
   Controls the servo motor.  
   üì¶ Install via Library Manager: `Servo by Arduino`

2. **LiquidCrystal_I2C**  
   Controls the I2C LCD display.  
   üì¶ Install via Library Manager or from GitHub:[LiquidCrystal_I2C by Frank de Brabander](https://github.com/fdebrabander/Arduino-LiquidCrystal-I2C-library)


3. **MFRC522**  
   For interacting with the RC522 RFID reader.  
  üì¶ Install via Library Manager or from GitHub:
[MFRC522 Library by Miguel Balboa](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid)

5. **SPI**  
Required for communication with the RFID module.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. **Setup Phase**
- The system initializes the servo motor to the "open" position.
- LCD shows a welcome message prompting the user to scan a card.

### 2. **Authentication**
- When an RFID card is scanned:
- Its UID is read and compared with the authorized UID stored in the code.
- If it matches:
 - If the door is open, it locks (servo moves to 0¬∞).
 - If the door is locked, it opens (servo moves to 90¬∞).
 - LCD shows a success message.
- If it doesn‚Äôt match:
 - Increments a failed attempts counter.
 - Displays an "Invalid Card" warning on the LCD.

### 3. **Security Lockout**
- After **3 invalid attempts**, the system enters a **10-second lockout**.
- During lockout:
- No cards are processed.
- LCD shows countdown.
- Once timeout ends, normal operation resumes.

## üõ† How to Use

1. Upload `RFID_tag_scan_code.ino` to your Arduino.
2. Open the **Serial Monitor** (9600 baud) and scan your RFID card.
3. Note the UID printed ‚Äî copy and update this UID inside `Door_Lock_system_main.ino` under the `String UID` variable.
4. Upload `Door_Lock_system_main.ino` to your Arduino.
5. Power the system, scan your card, and watch it work!
